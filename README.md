# DearStellar

DearStellar is a Twitter bot that listens to mentions from Stellar users who want their account balances to be checked. The Stellar users are instructed to tweet their account ID's in a particular format. The Twitter bot collects the account ID from the tweet and makes use of it to find the account balance. When this is done, the Twitter bot tweets back at the Twitter user to inform them about the success of the process or an error report. The account balance is then sent as a direct message to the Twitter user. The programming language used is Javascript and it was done using Node.js.   

# Prerequisites

In order to make proper use of this application, you will need to have a valid Stellar account, a Twitter account, and also be following @DearStellar or have your direct message open to everyone on Twitter. You will also need to tweet @DearStellar in the format - "@DearStellar balance YOUR-ACCOUNTID" for your request to be processed completely. If you do not tweet in this format, an automated tweet will be sent from @DearStellar asking you to tweet in the correct format.
